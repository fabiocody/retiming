## Retiming Synchronous Circuitry

The code in this repository is a Python porting of the algorithms described in the paper *Retiming Synchronous Circuitry*
by Charles E. Leiserson and James B. Saxe , published in 1986. The paper describes a circuit transformation called *retiming*,
in which registers are added at some points in a circuit and removed from others in such a way that the functional
behavior of the circuit as a whole is preserved.

## How to test the code

```
$ cd $PROJECT_DIR/src
$ pytest tests.py
```

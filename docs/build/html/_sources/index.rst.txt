Retiming Synchronous Circuits Documentation
===========================================

The code in this repository is a Python porting of the algorithms described in the paper *Retiming Synchronous Circuitry*
by Charles E. Lerserson and James B. Saxe, published in 1986. The paper describes a circuit transformation called *retiming*,
in which registers are added at some points in a circuit and removed from others in such a way that the functional
behavior of the circuit as a whole is preserved.
